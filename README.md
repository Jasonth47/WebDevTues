# WebDevTues

Hello! this is my final project for Code Louisvilles webdev1 course.
This is a basic landing page for me as a programer.
I look forward to adding more content and do other projects to link to this page!
below is this list of course requirments



Project Plan for Final Project.

  Completed on time.
  

Project must be visually appealing.

  I think my page is somewhat visually pleasing with the styling.
  

You must include a minimum of 2 media queries that create a better layout/user experience

  two media quieries, one @768px width and one @1200px width. There isnt a ton of content to style so most of what both quieries do is hange styling like flex-directions, padding, and flex-box sizes. the @768 media quiery hides my hamburger nav menu.
  

Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits

  Project submitted and i have alot of separate commits
  
 
Project includes a README file that explains the following:

  I hope this counts??
  
  
Project must be a fully formed website with headers, footers, and body sections.

  the project is fully formed
  

HTML must be your best efforts at being semantic (What is Semantic HTML?)

  I tried my best to make the HTML as semantic as i could
  

Choose at least 3 options from the list below, consider a 4th option in-case one malfunctions.

 ( 1.Create a responsive menu with CSS
  2.Create a responsive menu with JavaScript)- My responsive nav menu uses both CSS and JavaScript so im guessing this counts as one.
  
  3.Run PageSpeed Insights from google.com get a score of 80 or better-My project scored well over 80 for proformance and accessibility in both the google insight link and in lighthouse.
  
  4.Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover.- Ii added hover elements styling all of my linked buttons. the hover affect for my project-button are preactivade in moble form but I still think it looks cool. 
  
  (5.Create a custom animation that animates across the screen
  6.Create a simple hide/show div with CSS)- I created a hamburger menu that animates across the screen in moible but is then hidden at larger screen sizes.
  
   7.Create accordion boxes to display different types of information.- Again hamburger menu maybe?
   
   8.Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page- Created an array of images that has one picked at random on load for my profile photo.


All projects must use either flexbox or grid for the page layout. (***)

Lots of flexbox fun!

All projects must take best efforts to be accessible (***)

My project is accessible on google insights but I need to practice making it more accessible with alt tags.
